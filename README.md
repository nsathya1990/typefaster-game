# TypefasterGame Overview

This is a simple multi-player game in the browser.
The games will be played between 2 users. Who will be able to type correctly a
given sentence, in the smallest amount of time, will win the game!

## Get started

### Clone the repo

```shell
git clone https://github.com/nsathya1990/typefaster-game
cd intern-angular
```

### Install npm packages

Install the `npm` packages described in the `package.json` and verify that it works:

```shell
npm install
```

### How to start it?

The `npm start` does JIT (Jut-In_Time) compilation of the application, watches for changes to the source files, runs the application on port `4200`.
Navigate to `http://localhost:4200/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.

```shell
npm start
```

Shut it down manually with `Ctrl-C`.

## Build

Run `ng build` to build the project. The build artifacts will be stored in the `dist/` directory. Use the `--prod` flag for a production build.

## Running unit tests

Run `ng test` to execute the unit tests via [Karma](https://karma-runner.github.io).

## Running end-to-end tests

Run `ng e2e` to execute the end-to-end tests via [Protractor](http://www.protractortest.org/).
